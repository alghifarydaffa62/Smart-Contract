# Voting Smart Contract

A secure and transparent voting system built on Ethereum that enables democratic decision-making with complete transparency and immutability.

## üîç Overview

This Voting smart contract provides a comprehensive voting mechanism for organizations where:
- An **Admin** (contract deployer) manages the entire voting process
- **Voters** are registered and can cast their votes for candidates
- **Candidates** are registered and compete for votes
- **Transparent results** are available in real-time and after voting concludes

The contract eliminates the need for traditional voting systems and provides complete transparency through blockchain technology.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Admin-controlled Process**: Only the contract deployer can manage voting operations
- **Voter Registration**: Secure registration system for eligible voters
- **Candidate Management**: Register candidates with unique IDs
- **Vote Casting**: One-vote-per-voter system with validation
- **Real-time Progress**: Monitor voting progress during active sessions
- **Immutable Results**: Transparent and tamper-proof voting results
- **Event Logging**: Comprehensive event emission for tracking all activities
- **Access Control**: Role-based permissions for different participants

## üèóÔ∏è Contract Architecture

### Participants

1. **Admin**: The party that deploys the contract and manages the voting process
2. **Voters**: Registered participants who can cast votes
3. **Candidates**: Registered participants who compete for votes

### State Variables

- `admin`: Address of the contract administrator
- `voteStart`: Boolean flag indicating if voting is active
- `ID`: Counter for generating unique candidate IDs
- `voters`: Mapping of voter addresses to their details
- `candidates`: Mapping of candidate addresses to their details
- `candidateList`: Array of all registered candidates

### Data Structures

```solidity
struct Voter {
    address voter;           // Voter's wallet address
    uint votedCandidate;     // ID of candidate they voted for
    bool hasVoted;           // Flag indicating if they have voted
    bool isRegistered;       // Flag indicating if they are registered
}

struct Candidate {
    address candidateAddr;   // Candidate's wallet address
    uint candidateID;        // Unique candidate identifier
    uint totalVote;          // Total votes received
    bool isCandidate;        // Flag indicating if they are a candidate
}
```

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Foundry](https://getfoundry.sh/) toolkit or [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/)
- Git
- MetaMask or similar Web3 wallet

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd voting-smart-contract

# For Foundry
forge install

# For Hardhat
npm install
```

### Environment Setup

Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```env
PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key_here
RPC_URL=your_rpc_url_here
ETHERSCAN_API_KEY=your_etherscan_api_key
```

## üìñ Usage

### 1. Contract Deployment

Deploy the contract (admin is automatically set as deployer):

```bash
# Deploy using Forge
forge create --rpc-url $RPC_URL --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY src/Voting.sol:Voting

# Or using Hardhat
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network <network-name>
```

### 2. Admin Operations

```bash
# Register a voter
cast send <CONTRACT_ADDRESS> "registerVoter(address)" <VOTER_ADDRESS> --rpc-url $RPC_URL --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY

# Register a candidate
cast send <CONTRACT_ADDRESS> "registerCandidate(address)" <CANDIDATE_ADDRESS> --rpc-url $RPC_URL --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY

# Start voting
cast send <CONTRACT_ADDRESS> "startVoting()" --rpc-url $RPC_URL --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY

# Close voting
cast send <CONTRACT_ADDRESS> "closeVoting()" --rpc-url $RPC_URL --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY
```

### 3. Voter Operations

```bash
# Cast a vote (using voter's private key)
cast send <CONTRACT_ADDRESS> "castVote(uint256)" <CANDIDATE_ID> --rpc-url $RPC_URL --private-key $VOTER_PRIVATE_KEY
```

### 4. Query Contract State

```bash
# Check voting status
cast call <CONTRACT_ADDRESS> "voteStart()" --rpc-url $RPC_URL

# Show current progress
cast call <CONTRACT_ADDRESS> "showProgress()" --rpc-url $RPC_URL

# Show final results (after voting ends)
cast call <CONTRACT_ADDRESS> "showResult()" --rpc-url $RPC_URL

```

## üîß Functions

### Administrative Functions

#### `registerVoter(address _voterAdd)`
- **Caller**: Admin only
- **Purpose**: Register a new voter
- **Requirements**: Voting not started, voter not already registered, valid address
- **Emits**: `registerVoterSuccess`

#### `registerCandidate(address _candidateAdd)`
- **Caller**: Admin only
- **Purpose**: Register a new candidate
- **Requirements**: Voting not started, candidate not already registered, not a registered voter
- **Emits**: `registerCandidateSuccess`

#### `startVoting()`
- **Caller**: Admin only
- **Purpose**: Start the voting process
- **Requirements**: Voting not already started
- **Emits**: `VotingStarted`

#### `closeVoting()`
- **Caller**: Admin only
- **Purpose**: End the voting process
- **Requirements**: Voting must be active
- **Emits**: `VotingEnded`

### Voter Functions

#### `castVote(uint candidateId)`
- **Caller**: Registered voters only
- **Purpose**: Cast a vote for a candidate
- **Requirements**: Voter registered, voting active, haven't voted yet, valid candidate ID
- **Emits**: `castVoteSuccess`

## üì° Events

```solidity
event registerVoterSuccess(address indexed admin, address indexed voter);
event registerCandidateSuccess(address indexed admin, address indexed candidate);
event castVoteSuccess(address indexed voter, uint indexed candidateVoted);
event VotingStarted(address indexed admin);
event VotingEnded(address indexed admin);
```

## üß™ Testing

Run the comprehensive test suite:

```bash
# Using Foundry
forge test

# Using Hardhat
npx hardhat test

# Run tests with detailed output
forge test -vvv

# Run specific test function
forge test --match-test testCastVote
```

## üö¢ Deployment

### Deployment Script Example

Create `script/Deploy.s.sol`:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.20;

import "forge-std/Script.sol";
import "../src/Voting.sol";

contract DeployScript is Script {
    function run() external {
        uint256 deployerPrivateKey = vm.envUint("PRIVATE_KEY");
        
        vm.startBroadcast(deployerPrivateKey);
        
        Voting voting = new Voting();
        
        vm.stopBroadcast();
        
        console.log("Voting contract deployed to:", address(voting));
        console.log("Admin address:", voting.admin());
    }
}
```
