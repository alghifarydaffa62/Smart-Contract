# Payroll Smart Contract

A decentralized payroll management system built on Ethereum that allows administrators to manage employee salaries with transparency and automation.

## üîç Overview

This Payroll smart contract provides a secure payroll management mechanism for organizations where:
- **Admin** (contract deployer) manages the payroll system
- **Employees** are registered with their wallet addresses and salary amounts
- **Automated payments** are executed to all employees in batch transactions
- **Transparent operations** are recorded on the blockchain for accountability

The contract eliminates the need for traditional payroll services and provides transparency through blockchain technology.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Admin-only Access**: Only the contract deployer can manage payroll operations
- **Employee Management**: Add and remove employees with their respective salaries
- **Batch Salary Payments**: Pay all employees in a single transaction
- **Balance Management**: Deposit funds to the contract for salary payments
- **Employee Verification**: Prevents duplicate employee registration
- **Event Logging**: Comprehensive event emission for tracking

## üèóÔ∏è Contract Architecture

### Participants

1. **Admin**: The party that deploys the contract and manages payroll operations
2. **Employees**: The parties that receive salary payments from the contract

### State Variables

- `employees[]`: Array of registered employees with their details
- `Admin`: Address of the contract administrator
- `companyBalance`: Current balance available for salary payments

### Employee Structure

```solidity
struct Employee {
    address employee;  // Employee's wallet address
    uint salary;       // Employee's salary amount (in wei)
}
```

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Foundry](https://getfoundry.sh/) toolkit or [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/)
- Git
- MetaMask or similar Web3 wallet

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd payroll-smart-contract

# For Foundry
forge install

# For Hardhat
npm install
```

### Environment Setup

Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```env
PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key_here
RPC_URL=your_rpc_url_here
ETHERSCAN_API_KEY=your_etherscan_api_key
```

## üìñ Usage

### 1. Contract Deployment

Deploy the contract (admin is automatically set as deployer):

```bash
# Deploy using Forge
forge create --rpc-url $RPC_URL --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY src/Payroll.sol:Payroll

# Or using Hardhat
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network <network-name>
```

### 2. Interact with Contract

Use cast for contract interactions:

```bash
# Deposit funds (replace with actual contract address)
cast send <CONTRACT_ADDRESS> "deposit()" --value 10ether --rpc-url $RPC_URL --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY

# Add employee
cast send <CONTRACT_ADDRESS> "addEmployee(address,uint256)" <EMPLOYEE_ADDRESS> 1000000000000000000 --rpc-url $RPC_URL --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY

# Pay all salaries
cast send <CONTRACT_ADDRESS> "paySalaries()" --rpc-url $RPC_URL --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY

# Remove employee
cast send <CONTRACT_ADDRESS> "removeEmployee(address)" <EMPLOYEE_ADDRESS> --rpc-url $RPC_URL --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY
```

### 3. Query Contract State

```bash
# Check employee count
cast call <CONTRACT_ADDRESS> "getEmployeeCount()" --rpc-url $RPC_URL

# Check total salaries
cast call <CONTRACT_ADDRESS> "getTotalSalaries()" --rpc-url $RPC_URL

# Check specific employee details
cast call <CONTRACT_ADDRESS> "getEmployee(uint256)" 0 --rpc-url $RPC_URL
```

## üîß Functions

### Administrative Functions

#### `deposit()`
- **Caller**: Admin only
- **Purpose**: Deposit Ether into the payroll contract
- **Requirements**: Must send Ether (value > 0)
- **Emits**: `depositSuccess`

#### `addEmployee(address _employee, uint _salary)`
- **Caller**: Admin only
- **Purpose**: Register a new employee with their salary
- **Requirements**: Employee not already registered, salary > 0
- **Emits**: `employeeRegisterSuccess`

#### `paySalaries()`
- **Caller**: Admin only
- **Purpose**: Pay salaries to all registered employees
- **Requirements**: Contract balance >= total salaries
- **Emits**: `salaryPayed` (for each employee)

#### `removeEmployee(address _employee)`
- **Caller**: Admin only
- **Purpose**: Remove an employee from the payroll
- **Requirements**: Employee must exist
- **Emits**: `employeeFired`

## üì° Events

```solidity
event depositSuccess(address indexed admin, uint amount);
event employeeRegisterSuccess(address indexed admin, address indexed employee, uint salary);
event salaryPayed(address indexed admin, address indexed employee, uint salary);
event employeeFired(address indexed admin, address employee);
```

## üß™ Testing

Run the comprehensive test suite using your preferred framework:

```bash
# Using Foundry
forge test

# Using Hardhat
npx hardhat test

# Run tests with detailed output
forge test -vvv

# Run specific test function
forge test --match-test testAddEmployee
```

### Detailed Test Coverage

**‚úÖ Core Functionality Tests:**
- `testDeposit()` - Validates successful Ether deposits
- `testAddEmployee()` - Confirms employee registration
- `testPaySalaries()` - Verifies batch salary payments
- `testRemoveEmployee()` - Tests employee removal

**‚úÖ Access Control Tests:**
- `testOnlyAdminCanDeposit()` - Ensures only admin can deposit
- `testOnlyAdminCanAddEmployee()` - Blocks non-admin employee additions
- `testOnlyAdminCanPaySalaries()` - Restricts salary payments to admin
- `testOnlyAdminCanRemoveEmployee()` - Limits employee removal to admin

**‚úÖ Input Validation Tests:**
- `testCannotDepositZeroEther()` - Prevents zero-value deposits
- `testCannotAddDuplicateEmployee()` - Blocks duplicate registrations
- `testCannotAddEmployeeWithZeroSalary()` - Prevents zero salary
- `testCannotPaySalariesWithInsufficientBalance()` - Blocks payment when underfunded

## üö¢ Deployment

### Deployment Script Example

Create `script/Deploy.s.sol`:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.20;

import "forge-std/Script.sol";
import "../src/Payroll.sol";

contract DeployScript is Script {
    function run() external {
        uint256 deployerPrivateKey = vm.envUint("PRIVATE_KEY");
        
        vm.startBroadcast(deployerPrivateKey);
        
        Payroll payroll = new Payroll();
        
        vm.stopBroadcast();
        
        console.log("Payroll deployed to:", address(payroll));
        console.log("Admin address:", payroll.Admin());
    }
}
```

### Hardhat Deployment Script

Create `scripts/deploy.js`:

```javascript
const { ethers } = require("hardhat");

async function main() {
    const [deployer] = await ethers.getSigners();
    
    console.log("Deploying Payroll with account:", deployer.address);
    
    const Payroll = await ethers.getContractFactory("Payroll");
    const payroll = await Payroll.deploy();
    
    await payroll.deployed();
    
    console.log("Payroll deployed to:", payroll.address);
    console.log("Admin address:", await payroll.Admin());
}

main()
    .then(() => process.exit(0))
    .catch((error) => {
        console.error(error);
        process.exit(1);
    });
```
